# personalportfolio
My personal portfolio for web development projects.
I am using this site as a way to showcase my knowledge, skills and abilities as a web developer.  No template here.  Just raw HTML, CSS, and a little Javascript for form processing.  In addition, I am using AWS to deploy and host this site. This project should be considered a work in progress rather than a finished product since it is frequently being updated.
